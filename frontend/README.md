## About The Project

![FlameStarters](https://github.com/earn-labs/flamestarters-dapp/blob/master/frontend/public/flamestarters_header.jpg?raw=true)

This repository contains the code for the frontend of a minting dApp for a collection of 177 unique AI-generated and human-curated pieces designed to ignite the EARNer in you! Collect rare characters like flintstone from the earliest days of mankind, or mint a bougie designer lighter. Hidden within the collection are seven legendary pieces that stand apart from all others.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
