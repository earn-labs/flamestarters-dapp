![FlameStarters](https://github.com/earn-labs/flamestarters-dapp/blob/master/frontend/public/flamestarters_header.jpg?raw=true)

A collection of 177 unique AI-generated and human-curated pieces designed to ignite the EARNer in you!

**[Smart Contracts](./contracts):**
Code to test and deploy the NFT smart contracts based on ERC721A standard

**[Frontend](./frontend):**
